##Algorithm Implementation
This is implementation of the Top-k String Search Algorithm. It basically is that given a collection of strings and a query string, returns the top-k strings with the smallest edit distances to the query string.

This implementation realizes the third algorithm in a paper: a range-based method method to Top-k problem.

The Dictionary and input files are the input. The output will be shown on terminal.
